## React Testing Libraries

Here's a summary of the purpose and role of each of those Node packages in React testing:

| Package                       | Purpose                                                      | Role in React Testing                                                                                                                                         |
| ----------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **jest**                      | A JavaScript testing framework developed by Facebook.        | Provides the core testing environment — runs tests, manages assertions, mocks modules, and reports results.                                                   |
| **jest-environment-jsdom**    | A Jest environment that simulates a browser using **jsdom**. | Allows Jest tests to run React components as if they were in a browser (since Node.js doesn't have a DOM by default).                                         |
| **@testing-library/react**    | A testing utility built for React components.                | Provides functions to render components and query their output in a way that mimics how users interact with the UI.                                           |
| **@testing-library/jest-dom** | A companion library for Jest and Testing Library.            | Extends Jest's `expect` assertions with custom matchers (e.g. `toBeInTheDocument()`, `toHaveTextContent()`) to make DOM testing more readable and expressive. |

---

### Summary

Together, these packages form a complete testing setup for React applications. **Jest** runs the tests and handles assertions, **jest-environment-jsdom** simulates a browser environment, **@testing-library/react** focuses on testing React components from the user's perspective, and **@testing-library/jest-dom** enhances test readability with intuitive DOM assertions.

## Mocking Fetch Calls

Here's a summary explaining the purpose and role of additional Node packages in testing (particularly for React or frontend apps) that we lean on when we need to mock items such as `fetch()` calls:

| Package                       | Purpose                                                     | Role in Testing                                                                                                                                  |
| ----------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **msw** (Mock Service Worker) | A library for API mocking by intercepting network requests. | Simulates server responses in tests (and during development) without needing a real backend — useful for testing components that make API calls. |
| **isomorphic-fetch**          | A universal (isomorphic) implementation of the Fetch API.   | Ensures `fetch()` is available in both Node (for tests) and browser environments — provides consistent HTTP request behavior.                    |
| **undici**                    | A modern, high-performance HTTP client for Node.js.         | Often used by Jest or test setups to polyfill or replace the global `fetch()` function in Node for more accurate and efficient request handling. |

---

### Summary

These packages enhance **network request testing** in React and JavaScript applications. **MSW** mocks APIs to isolate frontend logic from real servers, **isomorphic-fetch** ensures consistent fetch behavior across environments, and **undici** provides a fast, standards-compliant `fetch` implementation for Node. Together, they help create reliable, deterministic tests for components that depend on network interactions.
