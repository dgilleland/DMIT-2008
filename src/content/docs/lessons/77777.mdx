<Aside title="Do NOT Skip Class" type="caution">
This is <b>NOT</b> a substitute for your student workbook or attending Dan's classes. Rather, it's a supplement to help support what I do in class.
</Aside>

Believe it or not, I am following a plan (or at least, *trying to*)! You may not see it posted on this site, but on my local computer I can see the lesson plan.

If you do see a lesson plan posted here reviewing one of the **In-Class Demos** - Congratulations! Now you have some written reflection from me on a demo we did in class.
