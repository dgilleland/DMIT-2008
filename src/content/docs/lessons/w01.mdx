This first class of the term was an introduction to the course where we set up our Student Workbooks and reviewed using the terminal for running commands such as `git`, `cd`, etc.

<Aside title="note" type="tip">
  Section A01 had one day this week, while section A02 had two days. We covered the same material.
</Aside>

At a minimal, you should have the following CLIs (*Command Line Interfaces*) available to you in the terminal: `git`, `node`, `npm`. Additional CLIs that will be helpful (but not required for the course) are `pnpm` and `gh`.

Instructions for your system setup and using the terminal are available on my website for CPSC-1520.
