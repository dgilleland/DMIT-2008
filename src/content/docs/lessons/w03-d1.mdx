## NextJS Intro

 Steps

1. Install create-next-app
	`npm install -g create-next-app@latest`
2. Create a project with create-next-app
	`npx create-next-app@latest hello-next`
	This is going to take a while to build your project in the nested folder (hello-next)
4. Run the project
	Go in to the folder
	`cd hello-next`
	Run the project
	`npm run dev`
5. Change the title in the "pages/index.js" file in your "hello-next" project and see it change immediately on the page (this is hot module reload)
	- this is essentially the beginning to see what we're going to be building and how we're going to do it.

## NextJS Components Intro

Steps

1. Create and Run the Next.js Project
    Create the project
    `npx create-next-app@latest components-example`
    Go in to the folder
    `cd components-example`
    Run the project
    `npm run dev`
2. In the "index.js"
- remove everything in the "main" tag except for the title ("h1").
    - change it to a title you're comfortable with.
- remove the footer.
- Observe the differences on the page as you make these changes.
3. In your "components-example" example project create a folder named "components" in the root of your project.
4. in the "components" folder create a file named "Hello.js"
    - create a function named "Hello" with "export default" before the function keyword.
    - in that function just return some html in it.
5. import your newly created component in the "index.js" file in your "pages" folder with the following
```js
import Hello from '../components/Hello.js'
```
6. use that component in your "Home" component by writing

```jsx
<Hello />
```
under the title tag in the "main"

- Observe the differences on the page as you make the changes.

7. Create a new component called "NewConcept" in a folder called "NewConcept.js" like you did with the "Hello" component. The only difference is that you're going to pass a parameter named "props"
- in your component use the prop named "concept" in the component itself. It should look something like below.
```jsx
  return <p>
    In this class we'll learn: {props.concept}
  </p>
```

8. import it and use it in your "index.js"
- import it like below.

```jsx
        import NewConcept from '../components/NewConcept'
```

- use it under the the Hello and define a prop "concept" like below. 

```jsx
        <NewConcept concept={"how to import components"} />
        <NewConcept concept={"how to use props in a component"} />
        <NewConcept concept={"how to import components"} />
```

- This will pass in the "concept" as the argument of the previous step.
9. Create a componenet called "ComponentWrapper" in the same way that you've done with the past two (define the props parameter).
- In the function we're going to use a special prop named "children" like so.
```jsx
        return <div style={{color: props.textColor}}>
          {props.children}
        </div>
```

- this is an example using the "children" property. If an element has this it can wrap other components (see the next step) or you can "nest" components in its' definition. 
- this is an example using the "style" property on elements which is given to us by "react". Although we won't use this much in the course it is a way (not the only/best way). If you want to [read more about style read here](https://reactjs.org/docs/dom-elements.html#style) 
10. import it in the index.js file and wrap all of the other components with it.
    
- import the component.
```jsx
    import ComponentWrapper from '../components/ComponentWrapper'
```

- nest all of the other components like so.
```jsx
        <ComponentWrapper textColor={"blue"}>
          <Hello />
          <NewConcept concept={"how to import components"} />
          <NewConcept concept={"how to use props in a component"} />
          <NewConcept concept={"how to import components"} />
        </ComponentWrapper>
```

- Observe the differences on the page.

Note: this notation is how we're going to name componts throughout the course. That is the file having the same as the name of the component.

## NextJS Component Lists

Steps

1. Create and Run the Next.js Project
    Create the project
    `npx create-next-app@latest components-lists-example`
    Go in to the folder
    `cd components-lists-example`
    Run the project
    `npm run dev`
2. In the "index.js"
- remove everything in the "main" tag except for the title ("h1").
    - change it to a title you're comfortable with.
- remove the footer.
- Observe the differences on the page as you make these changes.
3. Create a new "components" folder and in that folder create a component file named "SimpsonsCharacters.js". In that file create a function named "SimpsonsCharacters" like you would for any component (this should become second nature shortly.)
- import that file in your "index.js" file.
```js
import SimpsonsCharacters from '../components/SimpsonsCharacters'
```
- use the component in your JSX
```js
<SimpsonsCharacters />
```
4. in the "SimpsonsCharacters.js" file add a list of characters that we're going to loop over.
```js
const SIMPSON_CHARACTERS = [
	"Homer Simpson",
	"Bart Simpson",
	"Marge Simpson",
	"Mr. Burns",
	"Lisa Simpson",
	"Apu Nahasapeemapetilon",
	"Sideshow Bob",
	"Milhouse Van Houten",
	"Ned Flanders",
]
```

5. In the "SimpsonsCharacters" we're going to take a look at how to loop over lists in JSX.
- We're going to loop over the `SIMPSON_CHARACTERS` using `map` by using `{}` in the JSX to show that we're going to be using "js" in  your JSX.
- Below we're going to see that we use the `key` on each `<li></li>` element because this is a requirement with react. More on [lists and keys here](https://reactjs.org/docs/lists-and-keys.html#gatsby-focus-wrapper)
- The component now will look somethis like this.
```jsx
// SIMPSON_CHARACTERS defined up here.

export default function SimpsonsCharacters() {
  return <ul>
    {SIMPSON_CHARACTERS.map((characterName, index)=> {
      return <li key={index}>{characterName}</li>
    })}
  </ul>
}
```

- Observe the differences on the page as you make these changes.

## Bootstrap Component Library

Why?

Design is difficult, and there's a lot of boilerplate that you don't necessarily need to build from scratch.

You've probably dealt with bootstrap before, so we're going to see the "react" way of getting this library in your project.

Steps

1. Create and Run the Next.js Project
    Create the project
    `npx create-next-app@latest components-bootstrap-example`
    Go in to the folder
    `cd components-bootstrap-example`
    Run the project
    `npm run dev`
2. Stop your project (ctrl+c) and install react-bootstrap as seen in the [instructions here](https://react-bootstrap.github.io/getting-started/introduction)
- in your terminal (and at the root of the project) install bootstrap via npm `npm install react-bootstrap bootstrap`
- just as we've done in CPSC1520, we need to add the bootstrap stylesheets to the entry point of the application.
```js
import 'bootstrap/dist/css/bootstrap.min.css';
```
Note: if you remove the other stylesheets you'll have to modify your index.js file in the "pages" folder.

Note: for next.js we need to add this bootstrap to the `_app.js` file so that the entire application has access ([more information here](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/built-in-css-support#adding-a-global-stylesheet))

3. Remove the classes from all components and only keep the title like we've done in previous examples.

4. Let's add some components from this library explore how to understand and read the documentation.
- As you're reading the documentation of react bootstrap you need to understand how to import the components in your application. You can import components into your file by [looking at this part of the docs](https://react-bootstrap.github.io/getting-started/introduction/#importing-components)
	- Add the button like they do in the docs right here.
- Let's take a look a look at the [bootstrap grid](https://react-bootstrap.github.io/layout/grid/)
	- let's copy the code in the layout so that we can row and columns in our project.
	- import the components using the technique you just learned in the previous bullet point.
	- observe the changes on the page, but also see that the components "Col" and "Row" use the "children" prop (even if we don't see it) because they are "wrapping" other components.

5. Create a new "components" folder and create a component named "ComponentLibrariesList" in that folder.
- above the component, copy the list below into the file.
```js 
const UI_LIBRARY_LIST = [
	{
		name: "MUI",
		url: "https://mui.com/"
	},
	{
		name: "React Bootstrap (the one we're looking at)",
		url: "https://react-bootstrap.github.io/"
	},
	{
		name: "Ant Design",
		url: "https://ant.design/docs/react/introduce"
	},
	{
		name: "Semantic UI",
		url: "https://react.semantic-ui.com/"
	}
]
```
- we're going to loop through the `UI_LIBRARY_LIST` to display the list of available ui libraries. We're going to use the [bootstrap list groups](https://react-bootstrap.netlify.app/components/list-group/#basic-example)
to display this information.
- within the JSX we're going to loop through the list of object using `map` like we did for the last example. At the end this is what the JS will look like
```js
  return <ListGroup>
    { UI_LIBRARY_LIST.map((uiLibrary, index)=> {
        return <ListGroup.Item key={index}>
          <a href={uiLibrary.url}>{uiLibrary.name}</a>
        </ListGroup.Item>
      })
    }
  </ListGroup>
```

6. Import the "ComponentLibrariesList" in your "index.js" page, and use it in the JSX in one the "Col" defintions like so.
```js
<Col>
  <h4>Available component libraries</h4>
  <ComponentLibrariesList />
</Col>
```

## MUI Component Library

Why?

Design is difficult, and there's a lot of boilerplate that you don't necessarily need to build from scratch.

The MUI react is used by a whole bunch of companies that you've heard of/used their applications. You can take a look at the details 

Steps

1. Create and Run the Next.js Project
    Create the project
    `npx create-next-app@latest components-mui-example`
    Go in to the folder
    `cd components-mui-example`
    Run the project
    `npm run dev`

2. Stop your project (ctrl+c) and install MUI using [these intructions](https://mui.com/material-ui/getting-started/installation/)
- in your terminal (and the root of the project) install MUI via npm with `npm install @mui/material @emotion/react @emotion/styled
`
- If you want the roboto font you can add the Roboto font to the "Head" component of the JSX like so
```html
<link
  rel="stylesheet"
  href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Roboto:300,400,500,700&display=swap"
/>
```
Note: We're going to learn about the file `_document.js` file in next.js which adds a header to each separate page which is a more appropriate place to add this. We're going to learn about this `_document.js` and the concept of pages in this framework later in the course. 
3. Remove everything in the "main" element and we're going to take a look at how to use the MUI component library. Here is the link to the [documentation here](https://mui.com/material-ui/getting-started/usage/#quick-start). It's very similar to the react-bootstrap library we looked at earlier. 
- We're going to use a [Container and a Box (docs here)](https://mui.com/material-ui/react-container/) to layout our site in the index.js as follows in the JSX:
```jsx
<Container maxWidth="sm">
  <Box sx={{ my: 4 }}>
    {/* we'll add some content here.*/}
  </Box>
</Container>
````
- We're going to use [Typography (docs here)](https://mui.com/material-ui/react-typography/#component)
```jsx
<Typography variant="h2" component="h2">
  MUI looks good.
</Typography>
<Typography variant="p" component="p">
  You can perhaps see why this is a popular package.
</Typography>         
```
- Observe the changes on the page.
- Explore the docs and see all the different types of components there are. In this course we're going to use this quite a bit, so you'll have to learn to get comfortable with navigating these docs and using it in your projects.
