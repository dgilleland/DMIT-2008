<a href="https://react.dev/" target="_blank">React</a> is a JavaScript framework for creating **components** in web applications. <a href="https://nextjs.org/" target="_blank">NextJS</a> is a meta-framework that supports React components and adds various extras to your app.

<Aside type="note" title="Three-Part Series" icon="list-format">
  *This is **part 1** of a 3-part set of classes on the **Intro to React and NextJS**.*

  - **Part 1** - An Introductionto React and NextJS
  - [Part 2](/DMIT-2008/w03-d2/) - Fundamentals of Stateless Components
  - [Part 3](/DMIT-2008/w04-d1/) - Component Libraries

NextJS includes features such as

- page routing
- API endpoints
- server-side rendering (SSR)
- static site generation (SSG)
- layout support
- image optimization
- CSS styling supports (including libraries)

There are more features in NextJS, but before we even begin to explore those, we need to understand **React**.

## React Components

**React** has been around since 2011. It was created by Facebook employee Jordan Walke and went open-source in 2013. Since then, it has grown and matured as the predominant JavaScript framework for **component development**. As of September 2025, the latest version of React is `19.1.0`.

### What are Components?

You can think of components as re-usable parts of a web page.

It might be a user avatar, or a file/folder treeview, or any number of things that you want on your page. The idea is that you - the web developer - break your web application into smaller pieces - *components* - that work independently to achieve some *visual* characteristics and/or some *functional* characteristics on your site. It's like designing your own lego blocks!

It's not just about reusability either. By breaking a web page down into components, you are practicing **modularization**. Modularizing our pages makes it easier to reason about and maintain our applications. This has been a principle of good software design for several decades. React helped bring this principle to web development.

Just like HTML tags, components can be **stacked** or **nested**. For example, in this HTML snippet, the `<h1>` tag is *stacked* on top of the paragraph tag. Meanwhile, the `<strong>` tag is *nested* inside the paragraph.

```html title="HTML snippet"
<h1>Welcome to React!</h1>
<p>The world of React is a world of <strong>components</strong>.</p>
```

If you think of just the tags themselves and ignore the text, you can see a tree-like structure of the HTML elements. This is how the DOM exists in your browser - a collection of elements that can contain child elements.

<FileTree>
- h1/
- p/
  - strong/
</FileTree>

Creating React components is like creating your own customized tag that you can drop into the DOM. It even looks a lot like HTML, thanks to **JSX**.

### What is JSX?

React components mix JavaScript functionality with a tag-based representation of vanilla HTML and custom React components. This tag-based representation is accomplished with <a href="https://react.dev/learn/writing-markup-with-jsx" target="_blank">JSX</a>.

**JSX** stands for *JavaScript XML*. In the React world, these files end with the extension `*.jsx`. It's a type of text file that goes through a separate parsing/interpretation process than ordinary `*.html` and `*.js` files. In fact, the browser isn't the one that processes JSX. Rather, it is *pre*-processed at *build time*. This pre-processing results in some JavaScript file(s) that can be sent to the browser by the web server.

### Stateful vs. Stateless Components

React components can be centered just around *visual representation* (stateless) or around some *data processing* (stateful). We'll dive deeper into the distinction between these in later lessons. For now, we'll explore stateless components.

Stateless components can still have JavaScript functionality to them, but they are less about representing some data that has to be maintained *across components* in the application. Rather, any data or information in the component is simply "passed down" through something called **Props**. *Props* is simply short for "properties", and you can think of those as being analagous to **attributes** on HTML tags.

### A React Component Example

Here's an example of a pair of super-simple React components.



It acts as a simple tree-view component in a stateless fashion.

```jsx title="TreeView.jsx"

```

```jsx title="TreeNode.jsx"

```

## TUTORIAL - Creating NextJS/React Projects

The process to create a new NextJS application that uses React is quite simple.

<Steps>
1. Run `npx create-next-app@latest <folder_name>` in the terminal, where `<folder_name>` is whatever name you choose for the application. This will put all the starter code in a subfolder of that name.
1. Choose whatever options you want in your NextJS application.
1. To run the app, `cd` into your subfolder and run `npm run dev`
</Steps>

Here are some notable aspects of the process.

### NextJS Setup Options

Everything begins with running `create-next-app` in the terminal.

```ps title="Powershell"
npx create-next-app@latest hello-next
```
   
This runs an external installer (`create-next-app@latest`) and passes in a folder name as the destination for the boilerplate code. If this is the first time running `create-next-app`, you will be prompted for permission to install it.

```ps title="VS Code Terminal" " y"
PS ~/src/B/nextjs-intro-START> npx create-next-app@atest hello-next
Need to install the following packages:
create-next-app@15.5.3
Ok to proceed? (y) y
```

During the setup process, `create-next-app` will prompt us with several questions. Use the following responses for a minimal set of boilerplate starter code.

- Would you like to use TypeScript? ... **No**
- Which linter would you like to use? » **None**
- Would you like to use Tailwind CSS? ... **No**
- Would you like your code inside a `src/` directory? ... **No**
- Would you like to use App Router? (recommended) ... **No**
- Would you like to use Turbopack? (recommended) ... **No**
- Would you like to customize the import alias (`@/*` by default)? ... **No**     

It produces the following files/folders in a subfolder named "hello-next".

<FileTree>
- node_modules/
- pages/
- public
  - api
    - hello.js
  - _app.js
  - _document.js
  - index.js
- styles/
- .gitignore
- jsconfig.json
- next.config.mjs
- package-lock.json
- package.json
- README.md
</FileTree>



4. Run the project
  Go in to the folder
  `cd hello-next`
  Run the project
  `npm run dev`
5. Change the title in the "pages/index.js" file in your "hello-next" project and see it change immediately on the page (this is hot module reload)
  - this is essentially the beginning to see what we're going to be building and how we're going to do it.
