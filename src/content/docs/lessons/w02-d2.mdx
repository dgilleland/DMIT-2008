There's a whole lot more to the JavaScript fundamentals than what we've explored in the previous demos. They include

- Destructuring objects and arrays.
- How the spread operator works (`...`).
- Using the spread operator with function parameters and arguments.
- Default parameters.
- What is a **closure** and how does it work?
- Documenting our functions/classes with JSDocs.
