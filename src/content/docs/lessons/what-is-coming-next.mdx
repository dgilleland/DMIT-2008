<Aside title="Work-In-Progress (WIP)" type="caution">
    This is a very busy term for me, so don't expect a lot of extra documentation this go-around. I will only post write-ups of in-class demos as I am able to (which won't be as often as I originally hoped).

    So, that means **come to class** if you want to see the in-class demos. And, as always, check my `Agenda.md` for your section.
