## What You Remember

<InClass term="Jan 2026" done={true} plan='in-class' />

We begin be reviewing the HTML for a simple web page. The relevant portions are highlighted below.

```html title="index.html"
<div class="container">
  <h1 class="text-center">What did you do over break?</h1>
  <form class="new-topic-form">
    <div class="mb-3">
      <label for="new-topic-input" class="form-label">Topic</label>
      <input type="text" name="new-topic" class="form-control" id="new-topic-input">
      <div class="invalid-feedback">
        Please enter a valid topic
      </div>
    </div>
    <button type="submit" class="btn btn-primary">Submit</button>
  </form>
  <h5 class="pt-3">Topics</h5>
  <ul class="topics-list list-group">
  </ul>
</div>    
```

The JavaScript file is empty, save for a comment about the format for each list item's content to be added to the unordered list each time the form is submitted.

```js title="js/index.js" {5-7}
/*
Enter JS here

HTML for list topic list item
<li class="list-group-item">
    NEW TOPIC HERE
</li>
*/
```

The goal is simple: Create an event handler that will respond to form submit events and add list items to the un-ordered list.

### Node Project Setup

We're going to need a web server for our project. We'll accomplish this by turning these simple files from our starter kit into an actual Node project, using <a href="https://parceljs.org/" target="_blank">Parcel</a> as the build and development server.

<Aside type="note" title="Avoid Live Server">
  You might have been tempted to just use the VS Code extension called "Live Server" to run and test the web page. But we're going to set that extension aside and do ***real*** JavaScript development by creating **Node projects**. This will be the common practice for the whole course.
</Aside>

<Steps>
1. Create a Node project by running `npm init -y` in the terminal. (Be sure your terminal path is at the root of this starter kit.) You should have the following as your contents in the folder.

    <FileTree>
    - ~ Folder holding the starter kit files
      - js
        - index.js
      - index.html
      - **package.json**
      - README.md
    </FileTree>

1. We'll add in `parcel` to the project by running `npm install parcel` in the terminal.
1. Update the `package.json` to include the following changes.

    ```diff lang="json" title="package.json"
    +   "source": "index.html",
        "scripts": {
    +     "start": "parcel",
    +     "build": "parcel build"
        },
    ```

1. Run the project by typing `npm run start` or `npm start` in the terminal. The web page should load correctly.
</Steps>

### Handling Form Submit

Now we can add in the functionality of the website. We'll create an event listener function for the form's `"submit"` event and hook it up to the form.

<Steps>
1. Create the following function in your `index.js` file.

    ```js title="index.js"
    const handleSubmit = function(evt) {
        // client-side only
        evt.preventDefault(); // stop the POST to the webserver

        const targetForm = evt.target;
        const textInput = targetForm.elements['new-topic'];

        if(textInput.value.trim() !== '') {
            // Good, I have text... 🚀
            const list = document.querySelector('ul');
            list.innerHTML += `<li>${textInput.value.trim()}</li>`;
            textInput.value = ''; // clear the input
            textInput.classList.remove('is-invalid');
        } else {
            // Bad input 😢
            textInput.classList.add('is-invalid');
        }
        textInput.focus();
    }
    ```

1. Add it to the form element so that it responds to the "submit" event.

    ```js title="index.js"
    const myForm = document.querySelector('form');
    myForm.addEventListener('submit', handleSubmit);
    ```

</Steps>

When we test it out, we should be able to add items to the unordered list through the form.

### What we Recalled

Through this simple example, we've recalled several JavaScript basics. In the end, you were able to

- [x] Create a Node-based project that uses Parcel
- [x] Use the DOM API to select elements from the page
- [x] Create and assign a function to acts as an **event handler** for an element on the page

### A Step Farther...

Take this review a step farther. Define a function that will use the `document.createElement()` and `document.createTextNode()` DOM API to build and then return the following list item as a *document fragment*. Then, replace the existing template string with this function call and append the list item to the unordered list using its `.appendChild()` function.

```html
<li class="list-group-item">
    NEW TOPIC HERE
</li>
```

## Astronauts

<InClass term="Jan 2026" done={false} plan="homework" />

Data is a core aspect of any and all websites, whether that data is simple hard-coded content (text, images, etc.) or information that is pulled from some API. In this demo, we explore <a href="https://lldev.thespacedevs.com/2.2.0" target="_blank">The Space Devs</a> public API to retrieve information about astronauts. Specifically, we'll be using the **Launch Library API 2**. The starter kit's `README.md` file contains a brief outline of the steps to follow.

### Project Setup

The instructions in the starter kit guided us to set up our Node project with the starter files (`npm init`) and then add a couple of third-party libraries (`npm install boostrap` and `npm install parcel --save-dev`). After a couple of small tweaks to `package.json` (see below), we're ready to run the site using `npm start` in the terminal.

```diff lang="json" title="package.json"
  {
    "name": "review-astronauts-example-START",
    "version": "1.0.0",
    "description": "In this example we're going to see past and present astronauts.",
-   "main": "index.js",
+   "source": "index.html",
    "scripts": {
-     "test": "echo \"Error: no test specified\" && exit 1"
+     "start": "parcel"
    },
    "keywords": [],
    "author": "",
    "license": "ISC"
  }
```

<Aside type="caution" title="Project Name and Description">
  When you create a `package.json` using `npm init -y`, the `-y` flag will accept all the default settings for the project. Part of those default have to do with the values supplied for the `"name"` and `"description"` of the project; if a `README.md` file is present, then *npm* will take the first *markdown* line as the name and the first paragraph as the description.

  This can be problematic if that first line is over 214 characters (the max limit of a package name) or if those defaults contains characters (or links) that `npm init` doesn't parse correctly. In some instances, it has caused project scripts to fail in certain environments.
  
  So, the rules of thumb you should follow are to
  
  1. Use a **short** `"name"` value that does not include spaces or uppercase characters; this name will be especially important if you wind up publishing your Node project as a stand-alone library.
  1. Write a **meaningful** `"description"` value that is **not too long** and is in **plain text** (no markdown or other special characters).

### Importing Stylesheets

The ReadMe for this project had us jump into exploring the API we're going to use. Before we do that, however, let's make use of Bootstrap in our site by importing it in our JavaScript entry point (`js/index.js`).

```js title="js/index.js"
import 'bootstrap/dist/css/bootstrap.min.css';
```

<Aside title="Dark Mode, anyone?" type="tip">
If you prefer Dark Mode with Bootstrap, you can accomplish it easily on the whole page by adding `data-bs-theme="dark"` to the `<html>` tag.
</Aside>

### Separation of Concerns

When deciding how to organize our JavaScript logic, a good principle to follow is **separation of concerns**. As such, we're using <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Modules" target="_blank">JavaScript Modules</a> and we're organizing our code in a way that separates API calls from the code that renders to the DOM.

<FileTree>
- ~ Starter kit folder
  - js
    - api The layer that gets JSON data
      - astronaut.js
    - dom The layer that renders to the DOM
      - astronaut.js
    - index.js The "main" entry point of our app
  - index.html
  - README.md
</FileTree>

### API Calls

There are a few ways we can make our API calls. The key thing to know is that our `fetch()` function returns a `Promise<Response>`. We'll keep it simple for now, and just ensure we return a list of the astronauts as a JavaScript object (meaning that we need to convert it from the JSON string returned by the API endpoint).

```js title="js/api/astronaut.js"
const BASE_URL = "https://lldev.thespacedevs.com/2.2.0"

// api functions here.
const getAstronautList = function() {
    return fetch(BASE_URL + '/astronaut/')
            .then(response => response.json());
}

export { getAstronautList }
```

To make our code available to other scripts, we need to `export` our function. In the main `index.js` of our app, we can import it and just dump out the data to the console (to make sure our API call is working).

```js title="js/index.js"
// js here.
import 'bootstrap/dist/css/bootstrap.min.css';
import { getAstronautList } from './api/astronaut';

getAstronautList().then(data => {
    console.log(data);
});
```

Besides ensuring that we are getting data back from *The Space Devs*, this gives us the opportunity to examine what **structure** or shape the data has. We'll need to know this when it comes to the DOM Rendering step.

<Aside type="tip" title="Read The Docs">
  The majority of our time as developers is spent *reading* code rather than *writing* code. That reading time includes going over whatever documentation surrounds code we're trying to understand. And whenever we are consuming API endpoints (external or internal), we must pay attention to the documentation.
  
  In our case the Astronaut's <a href="https://ll.thespacedevs.com/docs/#/astronauts" target="_blank">docs</a> and <a href="https://ll.thespacedevs.com/2.3.0/astronauts/" target="_blank">endpoints</a> are clearly laid out in The Space Devs website. They even have an <a href="https://spacelaunchnow.me/astronaut/" target="_blank">example of rendered data</a> we can explore.

  Published API endpoints act as a **contract** between the provider of the data (e.g.: *The Space Devs*) and the consumer (us developers). That's why so much time is spent in creating quality documentation on how to access and use APIs.
</Aside>

### DOM Rendering

The target for the astronaut data is the `<ul>` tag. Similar to the last demo, there is only one unordered list on the page.

```html title="index.html"
<div class="container">
  <h1 class="text-center">Past and Present Astronauts</h1>
  <ul class="astronaut-list list-group">
  </ul>
</div>    
```

As far as our rendering needs are concerned, all we need is the data about each individual astronaut and a reference to the `<ul>` for displaying the content. Let's build a shell of the function and ensure it is exported from our module.


```js title="js/dom/astronaut.js"
const renderAstronautListItem = function(astronautData, listElement) {
  // TODO: complete this function stub
}

export { renderAstronautListItem }
```

When we have an object as our parameter (`astronautData`) and we need to get several pieces of data from that object (in this case, to fill in placeholders in our template string), an excellent approach is to use <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Destructuring" target="_blank">**destructuring**</a>. For example, our astronaut data has a huge set of properties, but we are interested in only a few. With *destructuring syntax*, we can declare variables for the information we want displayed.

```js title="js/dom/astronaut.js"
const renderAstronautListItem = function(astronautData, listElement) {
    // Get the properties via destructuring the object
    const { name, bio } = astronautData;
}
```

With that in place, we can build our HTML template string with some basic content. We'll start with the name and bio, just to see if it's rendering correctly. We'll append the list item to the `listElement` reference.

```diff lang="js" title="js/dom/astronaut.js"
  const renderAstronautListItem = function(astronautData, listElement) {
      // Get the properties via destructuring the object
      const { name, bio } = astronautData;
+     const listItem = `<li>${name}<br />${bio}</li>`;
+     listElement.innerHTML += listItem;
  }
  
  export { renderAstronautListItem }
```

Returning to the entry point of our app, the next step is to call `renderAstronautListItem` with the data from the API call.

```diff lang="js" title="js/index.js"
  // js here.
  import 'bootstrap/dist/css/bootstrap.min.css';
  import { getAstronautList } from './api/astronaut';
+ import { renderAstronautListItem } from './dom/astronaut';
  
  getAstronautList().then(data => {
-     console.log(data);
+     // use the data.results array and render each astronaut
+     const listContainer = document.querySelector('ul');
+     data.results.forEach(person => {
+         renderAstronautListItem(person, listContainer);
+     });
  });
```


Our preliminary results should show some basic data for each astronaut.

> **TODO: Screenshot here**

To wrap things up, we can resume dropping all the astronaut data in our list item. I added a little extra for the status to indicate if the astronaut is currently on a space mission. Here is the final version of our `renderAstronautListItem` function.

```js title="js/dom/astronaut.js"
const renderAstronautListItem = function(astronautData, listElement) {
    // Get the properties via destructuring the object
    const { name, agency, bio, status, date_of_birth, in_space, nationality, profile_image_thumbnail } = astronautData;

    let statusDescription = status.name;
    if(in_space) {
        statusDescription += ' | Currently in Space'
    }
    const listItem = `<li href="#" class="list-group-item list-group-item-action">
        <div class="d-flex w-100 justify-content-between">
            <img src="${profile_image_thumbnail}" class="rounded float-start" alt="${name} thumbnail">    
            <h5 class="mb-1">${name} (${statusDescription})</h5>
            <small class="float-end">born ${date_of_birth}</small>
        </div>
        <small>${nationality} (${agency.name})</small>    
        <p class="mb-1">${bio}</p>
    </li>`;
    listElement.innerHTML += listItem;
}

export { renderAstronautListItem }
```
