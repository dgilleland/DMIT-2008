title: gyp Errors
description: The first assignment for the course, and students are aready getting errors running `npm install`. They're feeling gypped.

import { Aside, Badge, Card, CardGrid, Code, FileTree, Icon, LinkButton, LinkCard, Steps, TabItem, Tabs } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';
import { Image } from 'astro:assets';

So, students are doing their first assignment for the term. They have to get the backend server running. The code is all provided, so it *should* just be a matter of running `npm install` to kick things off.

But, they get hit with an error, and it's miles long in its description.

```ps title="Lines removed for brevity"
PS C:\GH\2008\asgn-1\backend> npm install
npm warn deprecated @npmcli/move-file@1.1.2: This functionality has been moved to @npmcli/fs

```

## The Solution

The clue to this error is in the parts near the end, with the lines that start with `npm error gyp ERR!`. It turns out that `node-gyp` ("gyp" stands for "generate your project") is having trouble (for whatever internal reason). Fortunately, the fix is really easy.

Simply run the following in the terminal:

```ps
npm update
```

Now, when you try `npm install` once again, everything should run smooth. Whew!
