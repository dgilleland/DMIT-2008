<Image src={dg} alt="Dan Gilleland (NAIT)" class="float-end" width="75" /> My name is Dan Gilleland. I began this site in September 2025 as a place to put my ad-hoc resources that support [my **DMIT-2008** classes](#audience--content-advisory).

{/* I'm continuing to use this for my **September 2025** classes as well. */}

Why this site instead of the official <abbr title="Learning Management System">LMS</abbr>? Because this is **way easier to maintain**, and the effort involved in authoring doesn't need to be hindered by the clunkyness of most <abbr title="Learning Management System">LMS</abbr>es available today.

In the DMIT-2008 course, most of your time will be spent outside of class with some readings and lots of practice with React and NextJS. To be successful in this course, you will need a very solid foundation in the JavaScript Fundamentals. Consider spending additional time early on exploring the material I created for my CPSC-1520 students.

## Using this site

Use the side-bar site navigation if you know where you want to go. If you are unsure of where to find what you're looking for, then use the built-in search (<kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>k</kbd>). It's pretty good, and is part of the [Astro Starlight](https://starlight.astro.build) framework this site is built on.

<Aside title="Where is it?">
This site is undergoing active changes. If you've been directed here by me (Dan) for a very recent update (like, in the last few minutes), and the content I pointed you to doesn't appear, then *force* a refresh of your browser by pressing <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>F5</kbd>
</Aside>

## Audience & Content Advisory

**On this site** you will find tutorials, how-to guides, references, and [explanations](/CPSC-1520/explanations/0000). I am applying the [Diátaxis framework](https://diataxis.fr/start-here/#the-four-kinds-of-documentation) in organizing and authoring the content on this site. You can view the [commit history](https://github.com/dgilleland/CPSC-1520/commits/main/) to see what's new.

<Aside type="caution">
This site is *temporary*, so don't expect any bookmarks to work after April 2026. I am, however, planning on taking *some* of the work done here and publishing it into a longer-lived site on **Programming Fundamentals for JavaScript/TypeScript**.

For my students this semester (Jan-Apr 2026), you can find my <a target="_blank" href="https://dgilleland.github.io/schedule">**teaching schedule**</a> online (blank parts of my schedule are taken up with prep, meetings, etc.). I also use an **Instructor Workbook** for each section to track what we've covered and what's upcoming. Choose the workbook for *your* section and **review the agenda**.

import agenda from '../../../assets/undraw/undraw_events-calendar_sudy.svg';

<Tabs>
  <Image src={agenda} alt="Agenda.md" class="float-end w-32" />
  <TabItem label="Section A01">
  Your classes are on **Wednesday** (on campus) and **Thursday** (online). As students in the *Web Design and Development* career path, the material you covered in CPSC-1520 is critical for success in the DMIT-2008 course. Check out the `Agenda.md` file in Dan's Instructor Workbook:

## Student Workbook and Integrations 💯

If you're one of my students, then you know that I *daily* reference Student Workbooks. You can add any of these tutorials to your workbook on your own (though I may give guidance on where to put them for in-class lessons). Here's how you can do that.

<Steps>
1. First, pick out some tutorial you want to add to your workbook (for example, [Querying the DOM](https://dgilleland.github.io/CPSC-1520/tutorials/0030)).
1. Choose a place in your workbook. For example, create a `query-dom` folder under the `src` folder.

   <FileTree>
   - docs/
   - src/
     - ...
     - query-dom/ Sample subfolder for your specific tutorial
     - ...
   - ReadMe.md
   </FileTree>

1. Follow the tutorial by creating the file(s) and adding the provided assets.
</Steps>

The student workbooks I assign in class are all based on <a href="https://github.com/dgilleland/DMIT-2008-Workbook" target="blank">this template repository</a>, which contains most of the starter kits described in this site.
