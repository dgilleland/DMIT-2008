<Aside type="note" title="Content Advisory">
    I am teaching React (and NextJS) for the first time (Sep-Dec 2025). I've played with several frameworks (Knockout, Angular, Vue, Svelte, and best of all **Astro** 🚀), but React was one that I decided to skip over. Why? Mostly, because the JavaScript world was a side interest and most of my day-time teaching revolved around C# and the Microsoft tech stack.

    **But**,I've been making the transition to the JS world (*and hoping we start teaching TypeScript*) since about 2023. For the first time, I'm needing to teach React. And the demos I have are a bit old.

    I wanted to know some history of React (especially *breaking changes*). Where could I learn about this? Why not use AI?....

## A Short History

Here’s a **short history** of both **React** and **Next.js**, grouped by associated major versions, with key changes for each.
I skip the earliest minor versions and focus on more impactful milestones.

---

### React + Next.js major version pairs

#### React 15 & Next.js (≈ 9.x)

**React 15 (2016)**

* Focus on performance improvements, smaller bundle size, better support for large/complex UIs. ([nuhmans.com][1])
* Error boundaries weren’t yet in 15 (they came in 16), but this version laid groundwork. ([nuhmans.com][1])
  **Next.js around 9.x (2020)**
* In Next.js 9.2 (Jan 2020) introduced built-in CSS support for global and CSS modules, improved code splitting, and catch-all dynamic routes. ([Next.js][2])
* In 9.5 (July 2020) added **Incremental Static Regeneration (ISR)**, rewrites & redirects – enabling pages to be updated after build. ([DEV Community][3])
  **Why group them?** By the time Next.js 9 was mature, React was still in the pre-Hooks era and many larger architectural changes were yet to come.

---

#### React 16 & Next.js 10/11

**React 16 (2017)**

* Introduced the “Fiber” architecture (new reconciliation engine) enabling improved concurrency, better scheduling, more robust updates. ([nuhmans.com][1])
* Added fragments, error boundaries, portals. ([nuhmans.com][1])
  **Next.js 10 (Oct 2020) / 11 (June 2021)**
* Next.js 11 introduced Webpack 5 support, better DX and tooling. ([DEV Community][3])
* Next.js 10 had earlier maturity in types, optimizations, but less dramatic than later versions.
  **Key takeaway:** This era was about stabilization and modernizing build tools, and React had shifted to its new engine.

---

#### React 17 & Next.js 12

**React 17 (October 2020)**

* No major new features for developers (hence sometimes called “the upgrade for upgrades”). ([This Dot Labs][4])
* Changes under the hood: event system changed (handlers attached to root container instead of document) to allow gradual upgrades. ([React][5])
  **Next.js 12 (Oct 2021)**
* Introduced a Rust-based compiler infrastructure (SWC), improving build speed dramatically. ([Next.js][6])
* Experimental features: React Server Components support, HTTP streaming for SSR, ES Modules/URL imports. ([Next.js][6])
  **Why pair them?** React 17 laid groundwork for smoother transitions; Next.js 12 brought in infrastructure changes that set the stage for new paradigms.

---

#### React 18 & Next.js 13

**React 18 (March 2022)**

* Major features: Automatic batching (updates inside promises/timers get batched), Concurrent Rendering (opt-in), `useId`, `useSyncExternalStore`, improved Suspense support. ([Medium][7])
  **Next.js 13 (Oct 2022)**
* Introduced the new `app/` directory (optional) with layouts, nested routing, React Server Components support, streaming, `fetch` caching APIs inside components. ([Next.js][8])
* Added Turbopack (Rust-based bundler) in alpha. ([Next.js][8])
* Breaking changes: minimum React bumped to 18.2.0, Node.js minimum bumped, changed `next/link` and `next/image` behavior etc. ([nextjs.im][9])
  **Significance:** This is the era of rethinking how front-end apps are structured (data fetching, streaming, server components) and React’s concurrency features become more relevant.

---

#### React 19 & Next.js 14/15

**React 19 (Dec 2024)**

* Introduced: *Actions* (to simplify state updates with async functions), new React DOM static APIs (`prerender`/`prerenderToNodeStream`) for streaming/static generation. ([react.dev][10])
  **Next.js 14 (Oct 2023) & Next.js 15 (Oct 2024)**
* Next.js 14 improved memory management on Edge Runtimes. ([DEV Community][3])
* Next.js 15: supports React 19, stable Turbopack for production builds, new caching models (Partial Pre-Rendering), and major performance bundler upgrades. ([Next.js 15][11])
  **Why this pairing?** Next.js continued to push boundaries of server/client hybrid, edge capabilities and React introduced features that enable even more efficient server/client coordination.

## A More Exhaustive Timeline

Here is a more **exhaustive timeline** of major versions for both React and Next.js, grouped by roughly associated version-eras, with key changes and release notes. This should help when planning migrations or understanding which features appeared when.

---

## React version history

Based on major versions 15 → 16 → 17 → 18 → 19. ([VersionLog][1])

### React 15 (April 2016)

* Release date: 7 Apr 2016. ([VersionLog][1])
* Focus: Improved performance, reduced bundle size, more stable render behaviour. ([GeeksforGeeks][2])
* Still using older reconciliation engine (pre-Fiber).
* Error boundaries not yet built-in (added in React 16).

### React 16 (September 2017)

* Release date: 26 Sep 2017. ([VersionLog][1])
* Major underlying change: introduction of the “Fiber” architecture (new reconciliation engine) enabling incremental rendering, better handling of large trees, ability to pause/interrupt/resume tasks. ([IJIRSET][3])
* New features: error boundaries (catch JS errors in component tree), fragments (`<>…</>`), portals, support for returning arrays of elements.
* Deprecated older lifecycle methods (some warnings).
* Foundation set for later features like concurrent rendering.

### React 17 (October 2020)

* Release date: 20 Oct 2020. ([VersionLog][1])
* Characterised as a “stepping-stone” release: no major new developer-facing features, instead many under-the-hood changes to make upgrades easier, changed event system (handlers attach to root container rather than document) to facilitate incremental upgrades. ([reddit.com][4])
* New JSX transform supported: you no longer always need to import `React` when using JSX (with appropriate setup). ([reddit.com][5])
* Good version for gradual upgrades; less breaking change risk.

### React 18 (March 2022)

* Release date: 29 Mar 2022. ([VersionLog][1])
* Key features:

  * *Automatic batching* of state updates: previously only batched inside React event handlers; React 18 batches updates even within promises/timeouts/fetches. ([Fynd Academy][6])
  * *Concurrent Rendering* (opt-in): allows React to prepare multiple versions of the UI, pause, interrupt, and resume work. ([React][7])
  * *Transition API* (`startTransition`, `useTransition`): ability to mark non-urgent updates so UI stays responsive. ([Medium][8])
  * Improved `Suspense` (data fetching support), selective hydration, improved SSR streaming support. ([Mathionix][9])
* Migration notes: need to use `createRoot` rather than `ReactDOM.render`, new root API. ([AppSignal Blog][10])

### React 19 (December 2024)

* Release date: 5 Dec 2024. ([VersionLog][1])
* Features:

  * *Actions*: for simplifying state updates via async functions (mentioned in blog posts).
  * New React compiler / improved performance features (e.g., `useEffectEvent()`, view transitions) according to announcements. ([Avolve.io][11])
* Important: This version (19.x) is the basis for many of the latest frameworks (e.g., Next.js newer versions) to adopt.

---

## Next.js version history

### Next.js 9.x (July 2019)

* Release date: 8 July 2019 for v9.0.0. ([endoflife.date][13])
* Key features:

  * Hybrid rendering: automatic static optimisation (pages without data needs are static). ([Magical Programmer][14])
  * API routes (`/pages/api`) allow backend endpoints inside Next.js. ([Magical Programmer][14])
  * Later in v9.3 (March 2020) global Sass & CSS modules support. ([DEV Community][15])
  * In v9.5 (July 2020) *Incremental Static Regeneration (ISR)* (Pages generated at build + updated after through `revalidate`) + rewrites & redirects. ([DEV Community][15])

### Next.js 10 (October 2020)

* Release date: 27 Oct 2020. ([endoflife.date][13])
* Key enhancements:

  * Built-in image optimisation (`<Image />`) improvements.
  * Internationalised routing support.
  * Improved Typescript/ESLint tooling.
  * Strengthening of static & server rendering patterns.
* At this point the pairing with React 16/17 was dominant for many apps.

### Next.js 11 (June 2021)

* Release date: 15 June 2021. ([EOL Support][12])
* Highlights:

  * Webpack 5 support became stable by default. ([Wikipedia][16])
  * Script optimisation (`next/script`), improved prefetching, faster builds, better DX.
  * Closer alignment with React 17 upgrades.

### Next.js 12 (October 2021)

* Release date: 26 Oct 2021. ([Next.js][17])
* Major release, labelled by the team as “our biggest release ever”. Features:

  * **Rust compiler** (via SWC) enabled by default for faster builds & refresh (~3× faster Fast Refresh, ~5× faster builds). ([Next.js][17])
  * Middleware (beta): ability to run code before request completes (edge functions, rewrites, authentication, etc.). ([Next.js][17])
  * Support for React 18 concurrent features (pre-preview) and Server Components (alpha) in Next.js. ([Next.js][17])
  * AVIF image support, native ES modules, URL imports.
* Breaking changes: Webpack 4 removed; `target` config deprecated; minimum Node version bumped. ([Next.js][17])

### Next.js 13 (October 2022)

* Release date: 26 Oct 2022. ([EOL Support][12])
* The “big paradigm shift” release:

  * New `app/` directory (App Router) **optional**, supporting nested layouts, server components, streaming, and new data-fetching patterns. ([DEV Community][15])
  * Integration of React Server Components (RSC) support.
  * Introduction of Turbopack (in alpha) as successor to Webpack.
  * Changed default behaviours for `next/link`, `next/image`, etc.
* Later in v13.4 (May 2023) the App Router reached stable status. ([Chris.lu][18])

### Next.js 14 (October 2023)

* Release date: 26 Oct 2023. ([Medium][19])
* Improvements:

  * App Router is default/recommended; further enhancements to nested layouts, streaming, server components.
  * Partial Pre-Rendering (PPR) support – hybrid of static + dynamic generation.
  * Server Actions (experimental) – allow server-side logic to be invoked directly from components without separate API routes.
  * Memory improvements for Edge Runtime.
* Upgrade notes: e.g., removal of `next export`, changes in `ImageResponse` import path, removal of `@next/font` in favour of built-in `next/font`. ([nextjs.im][20])

### Next.js 15 (October 2024)

* Release date: 21 Oct 2024. ([endoflife.date][13])
* Features:

  * Full production support for Turbopack bundler (Rust-based) for builds—aiming at much faster compile/bundle times. ([Avolve.io][11])
  * Built-in support for React 19, aligning to latest React features (actions, improved compiler, etc.). ([Avolve.io][11])
  * Further improvements in caching, build adapters, edge support.
* Migration considerations: Make sure to update peer dependencies for React and React-DOM accordingly.

### Next.js 16 (October 2025)

* Release date: 21 Oct 2025. ([Next.js][21])
* Current Active LTS version (as of Oct 2025). Features announced:

---

## Migration / Planning Notes

* When upgrading React, check library ecosystem support (many libraries catch up after major React versions).
* When upgrading Next.js, pay attention to: minimum Node version, removal/deprecation of features (e.g., `next export` in v14), routing changes (Pages Router → App Router), bundler changes (Webpack → Turbopack) and peer React versions.
* Because Next.js often tightly aligns with specific React features (e.g., React 18 features and Next.js 12/13), the pairing above matters: using a new Next.js version may require upgrading React.
* For large codebases, plan incremental upgrades (e.g., move to Next.js 12 first, then 13, then 14) rather than jumping many major versions in one go.
* Always review the official “Upgrade” guide for each major Next.js version (e.g., Next.js docs for version 14). ([nextjs.im][20])
